# Eneritz's Professional Statement

Hi! My name is Eneritz and I'm a particularly good communicator, highly detail-oriented and skilled problem-solver 
entry-level security analyst. My main goal is to protect people from potential risks and threats by developing my 
programming skills and learning more about the extensive and resourceful field of cybersecurity. As the technology and 
the internet are constantly changing so do we, being able to adapt to different circumstances makes the difference of
protecting people or not. Although the field of cybersecurity is quite new for me, I'm overly interested in learning 
different types of threats and how to protect organizations from them.
